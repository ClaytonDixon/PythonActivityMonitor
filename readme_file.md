### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Configuration File Location**

**The `config.txt` file MUST be placed in the same directory as:**
- The Python script (`activity_monitor.py`) if running from source
- The compiled executable (`activity_monitor.exe`) if using the standalone version

**Incorrect placement will cause the script to fail!**

```
‚úÖ Correct structure:
my-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activity_monitor.exe    (or activity_monitor.py)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.txt

‚ùå Incorrect - config.txt in wrong location:
my-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activity_monitor.exe
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.txt          (This won't work!)
